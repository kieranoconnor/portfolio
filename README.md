# Kieran O'Connor's Portfolio
Here is my official portfolio documenting my projects. The sections are as follows

## Computer Architecture
This class followed Bryant and O'Hallaron's Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective. I wrote in C and ASM to utilize pointers, interrupts, and optimization methods to develop a deeper understanding of computer systems. 

## Database Design and Management
This class introduced me to SQL, Relational Databases, algorithims, and a lot of basics about the logistics of databases. For the final project, I designed a RD in Oracle SQL to mimic the Database for an insurance agency. With an included command line interface written entirely in Java, this is a fully functional system that allows for customers, agents, and managers to have different sign ons with customized views and restrictions. 

Unfortunately, my Oracle instance was deleted after the class, but it is still a good examples of code quality and depth, as  well as a testament to my comprehension of Databases. 

## Fundamentals of Machine Learning
This class was very math heavy, bringing me through a large amount of the formulas and linear algebra behind lots of the main machine learning methods used today. This coding projects had me impelement many of these math formulas in python to prove their work. This is more demonstrating math comprehension, python coding ability, and machine learning foundations rather than real world ML applications. 


## Python ML Research
To supplement my class, I have done machine learning research with professors on the side. In the included example, I utilized a GCN, Global Vectors, and the Fakeddit dataset to attempt to determine fake news posts on Reddit. The goal of the project was to be able to create two graphs baesd on a post, one for the title and the other for an included image. By comparing these two graphs we hope to determine whether it is fake news or not. The dataset included categories for truthful, misleading, fake, satircal, and bot generated.
